# Reverse Engineering

## Overview

In the previous unit, we modularized our applications following the MVC paradigm and integrated a custom ORM into the Model layer. Like all things in software development, when we find ourselves repeating a task, we look for programmatic solutions. Because the implementation of object-relational mapping is a common task in full-stack web development, third-party libraries emerged to do the heavy-lifting for us. In this unit we will integrate Sequelize, a popular Node.js ORM, into our newly modularized applications.
