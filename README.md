# Reverse Engineering

In this assignment, you will reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining every file and its purpose. Please see below link:

## Overview

In the previous unit, we modularized our applications following the MVC paradigm and integrated a custom ORM into the Model layer. Like all things in software development, when we find ourselves repeating a task, we look for programmatic solutions. Because the implementation of object-relational mapping is a common task in full-stack web development, third-party libraries emerged to do the heavy-lifting for us. In this unit we will integrate Sequelize, a popular Node.js ORM, into our newly modularized applications.
